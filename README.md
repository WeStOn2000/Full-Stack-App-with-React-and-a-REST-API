Full Stack JavaScript Project: Courses App

Acknowledgments

This project is part of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript program. It demonstrates how to build a full-stack application using React for the front-end and Express with SQLite for the back-end.


Overview

This project is a Full Stack JavaScript application that demonstrates the use of React, React Context, React Hooks, React Router, and Express with SQLite for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting course data. It integrates both Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to provide a seamless experience for authenticated users.


The project provides an interface for users to view a list of courses, create new courses, update existing courses, and delete courses. Authentication is handled using basic authentication, which allows users to sign up, sign in, and manage their courses securely.


Features

React for building a dynamic front-end.
React Context API for state management (e.g., user authentication data).
React Router for navigation and routing between different parts of the application.
Express as the back-end server to handle API requests.
SQLite as the database for storing user data and courses.
Basic Authentication for secure user access and course management.
Postman for testing the API routes during development.
CSR (Client-Side Rendering) and SSR (Server-Side Rendering) for creating a robust application that can handle dynamic user interactions and server-side data fetching.

Tech Stack

Front-End:
React (Functional components, Hooks, Context API)
React Router (Client-Side Routing)
CSS (for styling)


Back-End:
Express (API routes)
SQLite (Database for storing user and course information)
Postman (API testing)
Authentication:

Basic authentication with Express for API protection.
